# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

Pretty confident with the `each` method. The video really helped. 

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I really like having to do some research to find the answers. It helps you retain the information more in my opinion. I had some productive struggle with finding the right thing to Google but I learned another ruby method in the process!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I want to keep practicing new problems to solve with `each` and other methods. Maybe I'll see if there are any similiar tyoe questions on the internet like the ones in this section. I have review/practice time already in my Calendar!

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

No questions really, just excited to learn more. I will ask my small group how they though it went!
